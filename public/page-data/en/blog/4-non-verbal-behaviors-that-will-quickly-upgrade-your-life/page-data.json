While verbal and written communication skills are important, research has shown that nonverbal behaviors make up a large percentage of our daily interpersonal communication.\n\nHow can you improve your nonverbal communication skills? The following tips can help you learn to read the nonverbal signals of other people and enhance your own ability to communicate effectively\n\n## 1 Pay Attention to Nonverbal Signals\n\nPeople can communicate information in numerous ways, so pay attention to things like eye contact, gestures, posture, body movements, and tone of voice. All of these signals can convey important information that is not put into words. \n\n>By paying closer attention to other people's unspoken behaviors, you will improve your own ability to communicate nonverbally.\n\n##  2 Look for Incongruent Behaviors \n\n If someone's words do not match their nonverbal behaviors, you should pay careful attention. For example, someone might tell you they are happy while frowning and staring at the ground.\n\nWhen words fail to match up with nonverbal signals, people tend to ignore what has been said and focus instead on unspoken expressions of moods, thoughts, and emotions. So when someone says one thing but their body language suggests something else, it can be useful to pay extra attention to those subtle nonverbal cues.  \n\n##  3 Focus on Tone of Voice \n\n Your tone of voice can convey a wealth of information, ranging from enthusiasm to disinterest to anger. Tone can be an effective way to amplify your message.\n\n>Start noticing how your tone of voice affects how others respond to you and try using your tone to emphasize ideas that you want to communicate.\n\nFor example, if you want to show genuine interest in something, express your enthusiasm by using an animated tone of voice. Such signals not only convey your feelings about a topic; they can also help generate interest in the people listening to you speak. \n\n## 4 Use Good Eye Contact \n\n Good eye contact is another essential nonverbal communication skill. When people fail to look others in the eye, it can seem as if they are evading or trying to hide something. On the other hand, too much eye contact can seem confrontational or intimidating.\n\nWhile eye contact is an important part of communication, it's important to remember that good eye contact does not mean staring fixedly into someone's eyes. How can you tell how much eye contact is appropriate?ï»¿\n\n>Some communication experts recommend intervals of eye contact lasting four to five seconds. Effective eye contact should feel natural and comfortable for both you and the person with whom you are speaking.","slug":"4 Non-Verbal Behaviors That Will Quickly Upgrade Your Life","imagenPrincipal":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7a32b00f9d13c13a8bb168a00816da5f/9398b/1_6_4_H6p_CO_Yi68yww_UO_k_F0g_993eec9232.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7a32b00f9d13c13a8bb168a00816da5f/9398b/1_6_4_H6p_CO_Yi68yww_UO_k_F0g_993eec9232.jpg 700w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7a32b00f9d13c13a8bb168a00816da5f/74bac/1_6_4_H6p_CO_Yi68yww_UO_k_F0g_993eec9232.webp 700w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6671428571428571}}}},"descripcionImagen":"Women talking.
