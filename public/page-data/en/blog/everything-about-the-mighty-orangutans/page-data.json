They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, but during the Pleistocene they ranged throughout Southeast Asia and South China. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). In 2017, a third species, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis), was definitively identified. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which split from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) between 19.3 to 15.7 million years ago.\n\nThe most arboreal of the great apes, orangutans spend most of their time in trees. They have proportionally long arms and short legs, and have reddish-brown hair covering their bodies. Adult males weigh about 75 kg (165 lb), while females reach about 37 kg (82 lb). Dominant adult males develop distinctive cheek pads or flanges and make long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals; younger subordinate males do not and more resemble adult females. Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes, social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring, who remain together for the first two years. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet, but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and bird eggs. They can live over 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.\n\nOrangutans are among the most intelligent primates. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes' learning abilities have been studied extensively. There may be distinctive cultures within populations. Orangutans have been featured in literature and art since at least the 18th century, particularly in works that comment on human society. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas and they have been kept in captive facilities around the world since at least the early 19th century.\n\nAll three orangutan species are considered critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction because of palm oil cultivation, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild. \n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name \"orangutan\" (also written orang-utan, orang utan, orangutang, and ourang-outang[1]) is derived from the Malay words orang, meaning \"person\", and hutan, meaning \"forest\".[2][3] The locals originally used the name to refer to actual forest-dwelling human beings, but the word underwent a semantic extension to include apes of the Pongo genus at an early stage in the history of Malay.[2][4]\n\nThe word orangutan appears, in its older form urangutan, in a variety of premodern sources in the Old Javanese language. The earliest of these is the Kakawin Ramayana, a ninth-century or early tenth-century Javanese adaption of the Sanskrit Ramayana. In these Old Javanese sources, the word urangutan refers only to apes and not to forest-dwelling human beings. The word was not originally Javanese, but was borrowed from an early Malayic language at least a thousand years ago. Hence the ultimate origin of the term \"orangutan\" as denoting the Pongo ape was most likely Old Malay.[2]\nOrangutan sketch by George Edwards\nSketch of \"The Man of the Woods\" by George Edwards, 1758\n\nThe first printed attestation of the word for the apes is in Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius' 1631 Historiae naturalis et medicae Indiae orientalis. He reported that Malays had informed him the ape could talk, but preferred not to \"lest he be compelled to labour\".[5] The word appeared in several German-language descriptions of Indonesian zoology in the 17th century. It has been argued that the word comes specifically from the Banjarese variety of Malay,[4] but the age of the Old Javanese sources mentioned above make Old Malay a more likely origin for the term. Cribb and colleagues (2014) suggest that Bontius' account referred not to apes (as this description was from Java where the apes were not known from) but to humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely cretinism) and that his use of the word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first to use the term in a publication a decade later.[6]:10–18\n\nThe word was first attested in English in 1691 in the form orang-outang, and variants ending with -ng are found in many languages. This spelling (and pronunciation) has remained in use in English up to the present but has come to be regarded as incorrect.[7][8][9] The loss of \"h\" in utan and the shift from -ng to -n has been taken to suggest the term entered English through Portuguese.[4] In Malay, the term was first attested in 1840, not as an indigenous name but referring to how the English called the animal.[10] The word 'orangutan' in Malay and Indonesian today was borrowed from English or Dutch in the 20th century—explaining why the initial 'h' of 'hutan' is also missing.[4]\n\nThe name of the genus, Pongo, comes from a 16th-century account by Andrew Battel, an English sailor held prisoner by the Portuguese in Angola, which describes two anthropoid \"monsters\" named Pongo and Engeco. He is now believed to have been describing gorillas, but in the 18th century, the terms orangutan and pongo were used for all great apes. French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède used the term Pongo for the genus in 1799.[11][6]:24–25 Battel's \"Pongo\", in turn, is from the Kongo word mpongi[12][13] or other cognates from the region: Lumbu pungu, Vili mpungu, or Yombi yimpungu.[14] \n\n","slug":"Everything about the mighty orangutans","imagenPrincipal":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/3832f/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/6c918/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.jpg 750w,\n/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/49438/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.jpg 1080w,\n/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/f4534/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.jpg 1366w,\n/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/3832f/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/66907/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.webp 750w,\n/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/27610/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.webp 1080w,\n/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/90004/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.webp 1366w,\n/static/d92e9b1eb3679113d77ffee51d10e9cf/e4c47/marcie_kennedy_6_O_i5_Jag_O_Vo_unsplash_c5ebe7d2cd.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.75}}}},"descripcionImagen":"Orangutan in a tree.
